Ethical Considerations
The first major area of consideration from an ethical perspective with respect to the dataset was whether there were specific legal protections surrounding it; specifically, was the data protected by copyright law? Could the data be used?

On the Kaggle site where the data was found (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/imls/museum-directory?resource=download), on the right side of the screen, there is a “License” header, and below that, a link to “CCO: Public Domain.”  That link takes the user to a “CC0 1.0 DEED/CC0 1.0 Universal” screen where there is an explicit “No Copyright” designation. And beside that designation is an explanation that “the person who associated a work with this deed has dedicated the work to the public domain by waiving all of his or her rights to the work worldwide under copyright law, including all related and neighboring rights, to the extent allowed by law.” In addition, it is stated that the work can be copied, modified, distributed, and performed without asking permission.

In further consideration of any copyright or other like legal protections, the primary source for the Kaggle dataset was also reviewed. On the Kaggle site, acknowledgement was given to the dataset being compiled from IMLS records, IRS records for tax-exempt organizations, and private foundation grant recipients. Review of the Institute of Museum and Library Sciences (IMLS) website itself (https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/museum-data-files) revealed that the museum data was compiled from multiple sources, including the IMLS’s own administrative data and records, Internal Revenue Service (IRS) nonprofit data, lists of grantees from private foundations, museum associations, and data obtained from multiple original source lists.

And in the IMLS’s section on public library survey data (https://www.imls.gov/research-evaluation/data-collection/public-libraries-survey), in particular, IMLS stated that the data files available on its website are public-use data files that are available without restriction and do not require a license. In addition, where applicable, the files had some data removed to protect the confidentiality of individuals and to assure that there is no individually identifiable information.

That satisfied due diligence with respect to any concerns from a copyright or license perspective, but because IMLS’s statements about individual identifiable information were specific to public library data and not museum data, due diligence continued to the second major area of ethical consideration, privacy. Was there any data in the museum dataset that would raise privacy concerns and be subject to applicable data and privacy regulations and laws?

Consideration of that was actually related to the first one about copyright and legal protections inasmuch as one of the sources for the dataset was IRS nonprofit data. In contrast to tax information on individuals, the IRS publishes corporate tax returns, including those on nonprofit organizations such as museums. Accordingly, the presence of financial information (income and revenue) on museums themselves in the dataset did not raise privacy concerns.

But were there still any privacy concerns relative to other data in the dataset? A full review of the dataset confirmed, as indicated by the IMLS on its website with respect at least to its public library survey data: the museum data also did not contain any individually identifiable information. Accordingly, the dataset cleared checkpoints with respect to major US federal laws and regulations that would otherwise be applicable – the Fair Credit Reporting Act of 1970, Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974, Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998, GrammLeach-Bliley Act of 1999, and California Consumer Privacy Act (2018). And because the dataset was confined to US museums and data exclusively on them, the dataset also cleared a checkpoint with respect to the General Data Privacy Regulation that applies to data on citizens of EU member states only.
